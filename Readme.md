# PlateMath - Weightlifting


PlateMath is a React Native App for determining which plates to put on a barbell to achieve the desired weight. PlateMath can also convert between lbs and kilos and apply percentages to your specified weight which is helpful when doing warmups or when you are performing workouts specified as a percentage of your 1RM.

I originally started writing platemath in 2017 as a way to learn React and React Native, so while I'm slowly refactoring some of the bad practices and overconcerned components, the codebase isn't currently in the best shape.

In addition to trying to bring the codebase up to par with my current understanding or React/Native best practices, I'm also working to make PlateMath feature complete, here's a list of features that I think the app needs before it's "done"

1. The ability to customize your "weight rack" (the selection of plates you have available)
1. The ability to specify your bar weight - currenly the app assumes a 20kg/45lb bar
1. Color plate graphics 
1. Add a bar graphic


Additionaly, the following features would be "nice to have":

1. Save your own preset weight for different lifts.
1. Customize how plates are stacked, for instance if you have 25lb plates on the bar and need to increase your weight by 20lbs, you usually just want to add a pair of 10s rather than pull the 25s off and replace them with 35s - so I'm thinking that there should be a way to "lock" the bar as it is rather than always using the minimum number of plates
1. Record workouts and count reps/sets
1. Plan workouts and swipe through each set or workout as you complete it
